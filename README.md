## The Problem

For this project I was tasked with making a site which would display gifs on a page.

## The Solution

The final product pings the GIFY API for ten gifs when one of the default buttons is clicked for the search term named in the button. Additionally, users can enter their own search term using the proveded form, which also appends a new button to the list with their term. Gifs can be cleared from the page using the button at the bottom of the page.

Gifs begin as still images which will toggle between playing and paused when clicked.
